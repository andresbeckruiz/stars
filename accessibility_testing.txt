1) A non-impaired user might benefit from increased web accessibility if the computer they are using
doesn't provide support for graphics, or if they are using a text-based browser. If a developer chooses to
provide text alternatives to visual content, they will be able to understand and enjoy the graphics even
without seeing them. Another way a non-impaired user might benefit from increased web accessibility is
if the computer they are using doesn't have access to sound output. If their is a caption for the audio
content, the user can enjoy and understand the audio content without having to hear it. Finally, a
non-impaired user might benefit from increased web accessibility if the font colors are high contrast
and the font size is big. Although the user might not be blind, they still wont have to strain their eyes
as much to read text, which will lead to the user benefiting from this increased accessibility.

2) One design choice that User Inyerface made that harmed my user experience was underlining certain
words to make it look like the words had links. To fix this, I would remove these link tags or underlines
from words that were not supposed to take the user to a new page. In addition, I would make sure that each
word or label that is meant to serve as a link is underlined to alert the user that they can click on the
label or word. Another design choice that harmed my user experience was that the contrast between some of
the text and the background page color was very low. Specifically, the light green text did not contrast well
with the blue background, which made it slightly harder to read the text. To fix this and improve visual
accessibility, I would choose a color for the text that has a higher contrast with the background color, such
as black. Finally, another design choice that harmed my user experience was that the forms for signing up
had actual text that you had to delete. For example, the "Choose Password" form looked like the text was
just a placeholder, but you actually had to delete the words "Choose Password" and then type in your
password. I would fix this by making "Choose Password" only a placeholder instead of the initial value
for the form, and I would do this for all the other forms as well.

3) One change to my site that I made to increase my Lighthouse score was giving all my active, focusable
elements a unique ID. Initially, two of my textarea tags had the same ID, so I changed this so they would be
unique. This improves accessibility for my site because it allows each unique element to be visible to
assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Another change to my site that I made to improve my score
was giving all my form elements associated labels. My inputs and textareas did not have these labels initially,
so I changed this by adding a label tag for each element. This change improves accessibility because it
allows form controls to be announced properly by assistive technologies. Finally, another change I made to my
site to increase my score was increasing the contrast between the text and the background color. Initially,
my main "Stars" header was in red, which led to a low contrast between the red and the pink background. To,
fix this, I made the font color for this header black so that I could increase the contrast. This improved
accessibility because it allows all users, even those who are non-impaired, to be able to read the text better
and not have to strain their eyes as much.
